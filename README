Hello !


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

NoTouchScreen is not available as a precompiled package, so you need
to compile it.

|_____________________________________|

It is easier than on Windows

- Install cmake
- Install OpenCV with the "dev" and "cv-highgui" packages.
Simple way: install any package related to OpenCV ^^
- Installl python (2.x series) with dev packges
- Install boost libraries and boost headers
- Install GCC (of course)
- Install make
- Download the source or
- Install git and git@github.com:Steren/notouchscreen.git wherever
you want to.
- cd notouchscreen
- mkdir Build
- cd Build
- cmake ../
- make

To launch, from the same directory:
- ./src/notouchscreen

|_____________________________________|



1) Install the tools:

- Install CMake: www.cmake.org. Accept to put Cmake in your path when asked
for in the installation wizard.
- Install Visual C++. If you dont have a license for Visual Studio Pro,
you can download and install Visual Studio Express 2010. It is free !
Find it here: http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/
If you want to compile on a 64 bits platform, you also need the Microsoft
Windows SDK, which is free too.
- Install boost. I recommend you to use the installer from www.boostpro.com
- Install python 3.x from www.python.org. I used the *.msi installer for windows.
- Add manually "C:\Python26\" (or the directory where you installed it) in the system path
- Optional: Install Qt. OpenCV can use it if you want for highgui features.


2) Compile OpenCV

It is necessary to build OpenCV yourself in order to get the OpenCV
dev files easily found by Cmake when compiling NoTouchScreen. Download
the source at http://opencv.willowgarage.com

- Extract the tarball in a folder. We call it "OpenCVSrcFolder". Be careful
you may not delete this folder after installation.
- Create folder "C:\Program Files\OpenCVX.X with X.X the version of OpenCV,
or whatever you want, it does not matter.
- Launch a Visual Studio command line. Do not use a basic "cmd" window.
It is available from the start menu.
- Get into C:/Program Files/OpenCVX.X
- Type cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\path\to\OpenCVSrcFolder
- Type nmake, and go get a coffee.
- When finished, type nmake install
- When finished, add manually "C:\Program Files\OpenCVX.X\bin"
in you system path.

3) Get notouchscreen

- You can download a archive if possible, if not, you'll have to
retrieve the source from Git hub.
- To do it, what I've done is installing MinGW then Msysgit which
is available here: http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/
- When asked for, accept to put "git" in your path.
- Launch a MinGW shell (available from the start menu).
- Get in a folder such as /c/Users/you/whateverplaceyouwant
- git clone git@github.com:Steren/notouchscreen.git

4) Compile notouchscreen

- Launch a Visual Studio command line. Do not use a basic "cmd" window.
It is available from the start menu.
- Get into C:\Users\you\whateverplaceyouwant
- mkdir Build
- cd Build
- cmake-gui ../
- Click on "configure", and select "Nmake files". You should have an error about python.
- Check the boxes "Grouped" and "Advanced" and in the "PYTHON" groupe, give cmake the rights pathes.
- Click again on "Configure". Everything should be ok.
- Click on generate
- Quit cmake-gui
- Type "nmake"


5) To launch, navigate to C:\Users\you\whateverplaceyouwant\Build\src
then double click "notouchscreen.exe"
